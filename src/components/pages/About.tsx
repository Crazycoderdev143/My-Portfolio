              I specialize in building full-stack web and mobile applications
              that are responsive, performant, and visually appealing. With a
              strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, I
              craft seamless digital experiences from database to browser. I
              focus on writing clean, modular, and maintainable code while
              following modern development standards and best practices. My
              approach combines thoughtful UI/UX design, scalable architecture,
              and efficient APIs to solve real-world problems through
              technology. Whether it's building from scratch or optimizing
              existing systems, Iâ€™m driven by a passion for quality, innovation,
              and continuous improvement.
